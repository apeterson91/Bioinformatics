## Coursera Algorithms for  Bioinformatics

My code and notes to follow along the [Coursera Course]("https://class.coursera.org/bioinformatics-002").
The course is separated into 6 Chapters, as are my book exercises notes:

### Chapter 1: Where in the Genome does replication begin?

### Chapter 2: How do we Sequence Antibiotics?

	* Branch and Bound Algorithm

### Chapter 3: Which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks?

	* Greedy Motif Search
	* Randomized Algorithm
	* Gibbs Sampling Algorithm

### Chapter 4: How do we Assemble Genomes?

	* Graph Search

### Chapter 5: How do we compare Biological Sequences?

### Chapter 6: Are there fragile regions in the Human Genome?
